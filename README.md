# Disease_Prediction_using_ML

### Hello People!!!
This project explores the use of various machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from users (patient) input symptoms.

# Algorithms Explored
The following algorithms have been explored in code:
```
1.Naive Bayes 
2.Decision Tree
3.Random Forest
4.Gradient Boosting
```
# Usage

Please make sure to install all dependencies before running the demo, using the following code:
```
pip install -r requirements
```
# Code Implementation
- The main.py File has been uploaded for the corresponding project.
+ Make sure to change the directory of the Training and Testing files that has been used in the code
+ Enjoy!!!
